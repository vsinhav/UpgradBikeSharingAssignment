# Bike Sharing
> # Problem Statement: 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Objective
- model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- identify the variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes

- Year
- holiday
- temp
- Season
- months
- weathersit
